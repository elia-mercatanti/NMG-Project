# Progetto di Machine Learning

Project for Numerical Methods for Graphics course. Development and implementation of some exercises based on Bézier Curves.

## Excercise 1
Realizes a Matlab function that implements de Casteljau algorithm for drawing Bézier Curves.

## Excercise 2
Takes as input the coordinates of the control polygon and use de Casteljau algorithm to visualize the relative Bézier curve.

## Excercise 3
Finds control points in the Bézier representation of the parametric with curve with equations X(t)=1+t+t^2; Y(t)=t^3 and with t in [0, 1],
display the control polygon and the relative Bézier curve.

## Excercise 4
Takes as input the coordinates of the control polygon of a cubic Bézier curve and use de Casteljau algorithm to perform the subdivision
of the curve given a parameter t_star chosen by the user. Display the control polygons of the two divided curves and verify that continuity
C^3 holds.

## Excercise 5
Starting from a cubic Bézier curve defined by vertices V0, V1, V2, V3, build grade l+3 Bézier curves, with 1>=1, whose control polygon is
the polygon V0, V1, V2 -- l times -- V2, V3. Shows an examples.

## Excercise 6
Takes as input the coordinates of the control polygon of a cubic Bézier curve use the degree elevation algorithm to find the control 
polygons of this curve elevated to 4, 5, 6 degrees and draws them.

## Excercise 7
Takes V0=(0,0,0), V1=(1,2,0), V2=(3,2,0), V3 =(6,-1,0) as control points of a cubic Bézier curve and builds one second cubic Bézier curve
that connects with continuity C^2 with the previus curve. Display the two curves and their respective control polygons.
